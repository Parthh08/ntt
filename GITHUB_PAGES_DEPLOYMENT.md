# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide - Seeds to Shine Academy

## ✅ **Simplified App Ready for GitHub Pages!**

I've completely rebuilt your Flutter web app with a much simpler, more reliable version that should work perfectly on GitHub Pages.

### 🔧 **What I Fixed:**

1. **⚠️ Removed Complex Animations:**
   - Removed animated_text_kit, animate_do, flutter_staggered_animations
   - Kept only essential, reliable Flutter animations
   - Much smaller bundle size and faster loading

2. **📞 Removed Phone Functionality (As Requested):**
   - ✅ No phone numbers anywhere
   - ✅ Only Email and Location contact options
   - ✅ "Contact Us" button opens contact form
   - ✅ Clean, simple interface

3. **🌐 Optimized for GitHub Pages:**
   - Proper base href configuration
   - Simplified loading screen
   - GitHub Actions workflow ready
   - Better asset loading

### 🎯 **Your Simplified App Features:**
- 🌱 **Clean Design** with Seeds to Shine Academy branding
- 📧 **Email Contact** only (seedtoshineNTT@gmail.com)
- 🗺️ **Location** (opens Google Maps)
- 📝 **Contact Form** with validation
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive** design
- ⚡ **Fast Loading** with minimal dependencies

## 🚀 **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**

### **Step 1: Push to GitHub**
```bash
# You need to push the changes to your GitHub repository
git add .
git commit -m "Simplified app for GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages**
1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/Parthh08/ntt`
2. Click on **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll down to **"Pages"** in the left sidebar
4. Under **"Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
5. The workflow will automatically deploy your site

### **Step 3: Access Your Live Site**
- Your site will be available at: `https://parthh08.github.io/ntt/`
- First deployment takes 2-3 minutes
- Future updates deploy automatically when you push to main

## 📁 **Alternative: Manual GitHub Pages Setup**

If the automatic deployment doesn't work:

### **Option 1: Upload build folder manually**
1. Build locally: `flutter build web --release --base-href /ntt/`
2. Go to your GitHub repository
3. Create a new branch called `gh-pages`
4. Upload all contents from `build/web/` to the root of `gh-pages` branch
5. Enable Pages to deploy from `gh-pages` branch

### **Option 2: Use GitHub Desktop**
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Clone your repository locally
3. Copy the simplified files I created
4. Commit and push to main
5. Enable GitHub Actions in repository settings
